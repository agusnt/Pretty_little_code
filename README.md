# Pretty little code

This repository is a compilation of multiple small C/C++ applications.
The funny part: you can't use any if, switch or loop in all the code or 
std::for_each type functions. Only use **gotos**!!!.

## Requirements

* Do not use if/switch/loops or std::for_each functions.
* Only C code with limited library usage.
* The code should compile with gcc/g++ using only a single comment.

## Code header

Use the following code header for your code:
'''C
/*
* Description
*
* @Build: command to Build
* @Exec: command to execute the code
*
* @Author: 
* @Date: 
* @Email: 
*/
'''

## List of code

* *prt_num*: print the numbers from 0 to 10
